Instructions for installing an Ubuntu root filesystem on an SD card
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The file "ubuntu1204-rfs.gz" contains a clean sample Ubuntu 12.04 root filesystem.
It can be downloaded from https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B99O3A0dDe67eXYza2dMb28waHM/edit?usp=sharing
Please note it is preloaded with RK3066 3.0.8+ modules so obviously update it with your kernel modules as required.

Typical installation would go alond the lines of:

1. Download "ubuntu1204-rfs.gz" file say to tmp (or '/tmp').
2. Enter 'cd /tmp' and then 'gunzip -d ubuntu1204-rfs.gz' which creates a file called ubuntu1204-rfs.
3. Make an ext4 filesystem on your SD card, for example 'mkfs.ext4 /dev/{whatever the device is called}'.
4. Label your new partition as linuxroot, for example 'e2label /dev/{whatever the partition is called} linuxroot'.
5. Make a mount point for your SD card if it doesn't exist already, for example 'mkdir /mnt/linuxroot'.
6. Mount your SD card, for example 'mount /dev/{whatever the partition is called} /mnt/linuxroot'.
7. Change directory to your mounted SD card, for example 'cd /mnt/linuxroot'.
8. Copy across the Ubuntu 12.04 root file filesystem, for example 'cpio -ivdum < /tmp/ubuntu1204-rfs'.
9. Tidy up, for example 'cd /tmp; rm ubuntu1204-rfs; umount /mnt/linuxroot; cd'.

This Ubuntu 12.04 root filesystem sets the hostname as LINUXIUMONE and contains one user 'linuxium' with password 'p'.
You will probably (hopefully) want to make this more secure and add yourself as a user, set a root password (if you must).
Also you can add useful packages like ssh and a vncserver.
