Instructions for compiling Ubuntu to run on NAND (i.e. running Ubuntu without having to use an SD card)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Split your Android image into component flash images of boot, kernel, system etc. and then unpack your boot image.
2.  From here extract the rk30xxnand.ko kernel module (either the 3.0.8 or 3.0.36 kernel version as applicable) and build into your initramfs.
    You can load the module as part of init just the same way Android does.
3.  Compile your kernel against your new initramfs with the CMD_LINE pointing root to "LABEL=linuxroot" as usual.
4.  Also compile a kernel using your new initramfs but with a CMD_LINE pointing to the NAND device you want to use for root
    e.g. root=/dev/mtdblock{some number}.
5.  Flash the "LABEL" kernel, boot from your SD card, and make an ext4 filesystem on your desired root mtdblock device.
6.  Copy an Ubuntu root filesystem to the root mtdblock device.
7.  Now flash the "NAND" device and it will boot without needing an SD card.

To give yourself a large enough space to run Ubuntu, change the parameters which control the partitions on the NAND.
You really only need a boot, kernel and Ubuntu partition as a miniumum.
Make sure however you give sufficient space to the kernel partition rather than using the default Android ones as when you
reflash your kernel image you don't want it to corrupt your NAND partition by bleeding into it due to size issues.

If you don't want to bother with steps 1&2 "initramfs-mtdblock.cpio" is a test 3.0.8 initramfs
and "parameter-linuxium-ubuntu" is a sample parameter file for repartitioning your NAND.

If you just want the rk30xxnand.ko kernel modules then the 3.0.8 one is "rk30xxnand_ko.ko.3.0.8+"
and the 3.0.36 one is "rk30xxnand_ko.ko.3.0.36+".

For step 3 "3.0.8-linuxium-config-ubuntu-sdcard" is an example 3.0.8 SD card kernel config
and for step 4 "3.0.8-linuxium-config-ubuntu-nand" is an example 3.0.8 NAND kernel config.

An example Ubuntu root filesystem is "ubuntu1204-rfs.gz" - see "README-install-Ubuntu-root-filesystem" for further details.
